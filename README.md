This project is constantly growing and serves me as a hands-on learning experience with C#.

The goal of this project is for me to have fun learning C#, to create an interesting and diverse simulation of humans, and to serve as a small stepping stone into game development and similar fields.

Little-to-no progress would be done if it wasn't for Evelyn, who has helped me time and time again with all the errors and mistakes I have. <3
