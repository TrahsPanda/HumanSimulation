Women start menstruating at age 13 and continues until age 51 which gives 38 years of reproduction.

"...after the third childbirth, a woman's arteries thicken and the blood pumping increases by more than 50%, doubling the risk of a heart attack."
For the sake of the simulation, the chance of a woman agreeing to having more than three children will be significantly lowered, and if agreed to the chance of death from the mother and child will significantly higher. Never a 100% "No." though.

Men aged 40 and higher will never try to reproduce.

I did some research during the 1.0 phase of this application, and I found out that there is a roughly:
1% chance of stillbirth
4% chance of neonatal
10%-20% chance of miscarriage
Which leads to a roughly 15%-25% chance of baby death... Using modern methods.

In the 1800s, 45% of babies died. It is very safe to assume given the curve from 1800 to 1850 that about 50% of babies would die without proper technology.
Once a generic "technology" value is added to the simulation, it'll have an effect on birth mortality.
